This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  If the app is launched from a deep link that includes query parameters with special characters, such as '+' or '%', the `Linking.getInitialURL()` method might fail to retrieve the URL correctly, returning `null` instead of the actual URL. This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application, as the app may not navigate to the correct screen or may not process the intended data.
